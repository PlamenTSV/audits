# Security Review Process

## Questions to the Project

1. What's the clear scope (.sol/.rs files) and nSLOC of the smart contracts?
2. Does the project have well-written specifications & code documentation?
3. What is the code test coverage percentage?
4. Have you had any audits so far?

Based on the answers to the above questions, we can discuss the deadline and payment accordingly.

## Vulnerability Fixes Review

After the agreed-upon time has passed, the project will receive the security review report. The project has up to 14 days to apply fixes to issues found. A single iteration of a "fixes review" will be executed by me, free of additional charges, to verify that your fixes are correct and the code is secure.

### Important Notes for the Fixes Review

- For any questions or clarifications on the vulnerabilities/recommendations in the report, you can reach out to me on the intended communication channel.
- Changes to be reviewed should only include fixes for the reported issues. No major refactorings, new features, or architectural changes should be included.
- In the case that fixes are too difficult to implement or more than one iteration of reviews is needed, then this is a special case that can be discussed independently of this review.

## Other Questions

1. What is your preferred communication channel (Discord, Twitter, Telegram, other) for additional questions from my part?
2. Are you okay with me publishing the security review report after you apply fixes?
3. Are you okay with me being transparent with our work, findings and payment?

## Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or if even the review will find any problems with your smart contracts.
